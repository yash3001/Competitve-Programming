Walks
1) Walk - A walk is a sequence of vertices and edges
2) Closed Walk - A walk that starts and ends on the same vertex

Trail
1) Trial - A walk with no repeated edges.
2) Circuit - A closed trial is call a circuit.

Path
1) Path - A path is walk with no repeated vertices.
2) Cycle - A closed path is called a cycle. The start and the end is repeated.

Euler Trial and Euler Circuit
1) Euler Trial - If there exists a trial that traverses every edge in the graph(only once), then its called an euler trial.
2) Euler Circuit - If there exists a circuit that traverses every edge in the graph(only once), then its called an euler circuit.
